Now let's throw you into the wild with no starter code!

You'll be creating a functional calculator using `state` and `onClick` handlers.

**Requirements:**

- You must build an app using `create-react-app` that takes in two values and returns the proper value.
- Make sure it's a good looking calculator - aka use the styling you've been practicing.
- Consider all prior feedback you've gotten and implement it into this app.

**Reminders:**

- Be consistent in your code - consider using a linter.
- Use React 16 and ES6 syntax
- Consider using a UI library. You're not limited to `reactstrap`!

**Stretch Goals:**
- Create buttons that add, subtract, divide and multiply.
- Create a list that documents all calculations done before a page is refreshed.
- Create a reusable input component that will take in props and utilize them multiple times.
