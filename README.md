<h1>Let's Build a Calculator</h1>  

Before you can contribute to our code base, you must have a solid grasp of functional components as well as React hooks. To give you some more experience with these concepts, you will be building a simple calculator app.   

The goal is to create a program that takes two numbers and adds them together. Then, you will add a multiply button, subtract button, and divide button. You MUST use functional components, and React hooks. Keep in mind the syntax is different with functional components.
